# EventHandler

## [EventHandler interface](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/v0.12.3/pkg/handler/eventhandler.go)

```go
// * Use EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc to transform an event for an object to a reconcile of an object
// of a different type - do this for events for types the Controller may be interested in, but doesn't create.
// (e.g. If Foo responds to cluster size events, map Node events to Foo objects.)
//
// Unless you are implementing your own EventHandler, you can ignore the functions on the EventHandler interface.
// Most users shouldn't need to implement their own EventHandler.
type EventHandler interface {
	// Create is called in response to an create event - e.g. Pod Creation.
	Create(event.CreateEvent, workqueue.RateLimitingInterface)

	// Update is called in response to an update event -  e.g. Pod Updated.
	Update(event.UpdateEvent, workqueue.RateLimitingInterface)

	// Delete is called in response to a delete event - e.g. Pod Deleted.
	Delete(event.DeleteEvent, workqueue.RateLimitingInterface)

	// Generic is called in response to an event of an unknown type or a synthetic event triggered as a cron or
	// external trigger request - e.g. reconcile Autoscaling, or a Webhook.
	Generic(event.GenericEvent, workqueue.RateLimitingInterface)
}
